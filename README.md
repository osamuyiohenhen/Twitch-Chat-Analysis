# My First Github Project
(WIP) This is my first independent Github project. I wanted to make this something I was somewhat passionate about, so I decided to work with TwitchAPI. This is currently an simple automated bot that interacts with a channel's chat (chosen by user), and displays it in the terminal.

# Main packages required (installed with pip):
twitchAPI <br/>
textblob

Note: This chatbot is currently configured using my own Twitch.tv ClientID and ClientSecret. To configure the bot using a separate account, please create a separate Twitch account and log into the Twitch Developer Console.
